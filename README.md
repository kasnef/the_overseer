# The Overseer

The Overseer: Master your flow. Syncs work-rest cycles by monitoring AI Agent (Antigravity/Windsurf) resource usage. Auto-opens web/apps while AI works, forces you back to code when done. Features high-pressure Task Tracking to kill laziness. Lightweight & cross-platform, built with Go, Wails & React.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
